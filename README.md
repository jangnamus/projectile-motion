# Projectile Motion
### Numerical analysis of projectile motion
<br/>
Final project for the FMF course Computational Tools in Physics (a.k.a. ROF).
Theme: *Projectile motion with air drag, wind and the Coriolis force*.
I used Python to obtain solutions numerically. 
<br/>
* **Code**: view the ```.py``` files.
* **Report**: [projectile-motion.pdf](https://github.com/gnzasao/projectile-motion/blob/master/projectile-motion.pdf).
